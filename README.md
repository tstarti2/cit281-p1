# Project 1: Mastering CLI, VSCode, and Node.js Development

In Project 1, I set out to achieve several learning objectives:

1. **Becoming Proficient with the Command Line Interface (CLI):**
   I dedicated time to mastering the command line interface (CLI) of my operating system. This involved tasks like creating and managing folders, which helped me understand how directories are structured and how to navigate them efficiently.

2. **Mastering CLI Commands:**
   I engaged in hands-on practice to become proficient with various CLI commands. This allowed me to perform tasks like file operations and system diagnostics quickly and effectively.

3. **Integrating Visual Studio Code (VSCode):**
   I explored the features of Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and learned how to integrate it into my workflow. VSCode proved to be a powerful tool for coding, debugging, and performing terminal operations, which significantly enhanced my development process.

4. **Scripting with Node.js:**
   I delved into writing and executing Node.js JavaScript files, focusing specifically on non-web server applications. Leveraging VSCode's terminal, I was able to develop and test my scripts seamlessly.

Overall, this project provided me with an immersive learning experience. I gained essential CLI skills, learned how to leverage the functionalities of VSCode, and became proficient in developing and debugging Node.js applications.
